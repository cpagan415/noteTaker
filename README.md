# Express.js Coding Challenge UCF: Note Taker 

## Description

This was a coding challenge done with UCF WebDev bootcamp. The coding challenge was to finish the creation of a Note Taker web application where a user can write notes, save notes, and delete notes. The challenege was to created an Express.js back that would revieve and retrieve note data from a JSON file. 

## Dependencies

* [Express](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express)
* [uniqid](https://www.npmjs.com/package/uniqid)

## Usage 

Application here: [Note Taker](https://maple-moose-24100.herokuapp.com/)

When the application link is opened, the user would be led to a homepage where they click the button 'Get Started' to open the note taker. The note taker page has a space where the user can type a note. Once the user finishes typing the note, they can click the save icon to save the note to the left hand side. The user can view notes again by clicking on the note title on the left hand side and delete the note by clicking on the red trash can. 

Whenever a note is created the json file displays a unique id which was done by the npm package uniqid.
